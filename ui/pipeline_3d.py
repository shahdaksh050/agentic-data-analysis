"""
The plate — the seven-stage RLM workflow drawn as a live technical drawing.

The scene itself lives in ``assets/pipeline_3d.js`` (Three.js + GSAP); this
module is the seam between it and Streamlit. It owns the state contract —
what a stage is, which inks the scene may use — and inlines both assets
into a single sandboxed iframe, because ``components.html`` has no way to
serve sibling files.

Streamlit re-runs the whole script on every interaction, so the component
mounts fresh each time and renders one snapshot of ``st.session_state``.
The scene replays the run on mount rather than streaming frames live.
