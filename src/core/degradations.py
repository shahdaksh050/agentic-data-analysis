"""
Observability (item 10) — turns every silent fallback into a visible one.

Each stage upstream (read_any's encoding/delimiter guesses, coerce_types'
repairs, profile_dataframe's sufficiency gate, a failed profiling pass)
already records what it did on its own structured result (ReadReport,
Coercion, DatasetProfile). This module is the single place that flattens
all of those into one human-readable list — "the degradations log" — so
the report and the UI render one thing instead of four separately-shaped
ad-hoc extractions that could drift out of sync with each other.

Pure function of already-computed data — no I/O, no new detection logic.
